# AI-Powered Corporate Expense Analysis System

This project is a prototype financial decision-support system designed to analyze corporate expenses, classify cost structures, and identify potential inefficiencies using AI-assisted analysis.

## Project Purpose
Large companies often struggle to clearly interpret where operational budgets are being consumed. This system simulates how AI can assist financial teams by:
- Categorizing expenses
- Identifying unnecessary or high-risk spending
- Generating management-level summaries
- Suggesting cost optimization opportunities

## System Architecture

1. Expense data input (simulated company financial data)
2. AI-based classification of expense types
3. Cost structure evaluation
4. Executive summary generation
5. Optimization suggestions

## Key Features

- Expense categorization (Operational vs Strategic)
- Cost anomaly detection
- AI-generated financial summaries
- Multi-model AI reasoning workflow
- Decision-support reporting format

## Technologies & Concepts Used

- Artificial Intelligence (LLM-based analysis)
- Prompt Engineering
- Financial Data Interpretation
- Expense Modeling
- Decision Support Systems

## Example Use Case

A company uploads quarterly expense data.  
The system analyzes spending distribution, flags inefficient cost centers, and produces a structured management report.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with real financial datasets
- Dashboard interface
- Automated report generation in PDF format
- API-based financial data input
